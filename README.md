## Introduction

Does the word 'coding' bother you as much as it bothers me? With this Chrome plugin, you can automatically replace it with the word 'programming' instead. It's still a work in progress and not available to download from the Chrome store just yet. Once it's finished and I'm happy with it, I'll work on:
- Custom word replacements
- A German language translation
- A port to Firefox

## Installation

I minify and bundle code and markup together using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org). Clone this Git repository, or download an archive, and run `npm install` in its directory.

From here, you can run `npm run build` to fire up Webpack. By default, it will move images from the images folder, compile SCSS and minify all available source code / markup.

If you want to run it in Chrome / Chromium, activate *Developer Mode* and open the unpacked `dist` directory to add the plugin to your browser.
